# Single node dev mode robustmq start

This example is used to quickly start a robustmq cluster with only one instance. This is suitable for starting in developer mode.

## Quick Start

Executing the following command will start three required component instances:

* placement-center
* mqtt-broker
* journal-server

At the same time, three runtime directories will be generated in the execution directory: `logs` (generated by the component), `robust-data-test` (generated by the component), and `process_logs` (component process logs).

```shell
$ ./start.sh
```

## Cleaning

Executing the cleanup script will clear the directories generated during runtime and exit the started component process.

```shell
$ ./stop.sh
```
