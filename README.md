    A high-performance distributed message queue built with Rust.
</h3>

> Tips:<br/>
> - This project is currently in its early preview stage and is undergoing rapid iteration and testing. A stable release is expected in the second half of 2025.<br/>
> - We are still growingâ€”please give us time to mature. Our ambition is for RobustMQ to become the next top-level Apache project in the message queue ecosystem.<br/>

## ðŸš€ Introduction

RobustMQ is a next-generation, high-performance, multi-protocol message queue system built in Rust. Our vision is to
create a unified messaging infrastructure tailored for AI systems. features:
- **High Performance**: Built with Rust, ensuring speed, efficiency and security.
- **Distributed architecture**: Computing, storage and scheduling are separated. Targeting cluster deployment, allowing for rapid expansion and contraction of capacity.
- **Multi-protocol**: Supports mainstream messaging protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, Kafka, and RocketMQ.
- **Plugin-based storage**: The storage layer is modularized, allowing for the selection of the appropriate storage engine based on the scenario, such as file storage, S3, HDFS, etc.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to deploy and manage.
- **Multi-tenancy**: In a physical cluster, multiple virtual clusters are allowed, thereby reducing deployment costs.

For more information, please refer to the official [website documentation](https://robustmq.com/).

## Architecture
![image](docs/images/robustmq-architecture.png)
- One binary, one process
- Support multiple network communication protocols
- Multi-protocol encoding and decodingï¼ŒDifferent protocols use different ports: MQTT (1883/1884/8083/8084), Kafka (9092), Grpc (1228)
- Plugin-based storage configuration
- Metadata Service Based on Raft and RocksDB

## Quick Start

$ cargo run --package cmd --bin broker-server 
```

### Packaging
```
$ make build
```
Generated binary packages are located in the "build" directory.

### Binary startup
```
$ cd build

## Contribution Guidelines
RobustMQ is still quite young. We hope to meet more people who are interested in Rust, infrastructure, and message queues, and explore the application of Rust in the field of message queues together. [GitHub Contribution Guide](https://robustmq.com/ContributionGuide/GitHub-Contribution-Guide.html)
