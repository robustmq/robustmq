# Prometheus Configuration Example for RobustMQ MQTT Broker Monitoring
# This is a sample configuration showing how to scrape metrics from RobustMQ

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s        # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds
  evaluation_interval: 15s    # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          # - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'
rule_files:
  - "robustmq-alerts.yml"
