# GitHub Contribution Guide

## 1. Creating an ISSUE

The main types of ISSUES include: feat, bug, test, refactor, chore, style, docs, perf, build, ci. The corresponding explanations are as follows:
- feat: New feature
- bug: Bug issue
- test: Additional test cases
- refactor: Code refactoring that is neither a new feature nor a bug fix
- docs: Changes and additions to documentation, including code comments
- perf: Code involving performance optimization, which requires proof of optimization
- build: Changes to the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to continuous integration configuration, including modifications to configuration files and scripts
- style: Code style changes, used for submission formatting, punctuation, etc., that do not affect the code
- chore: Mixed types of work, possibly involving multiple other types of changes

### Users and Contributors Creating ISSUES

For users and contributors, if there are new feature requirements or bug fixes, they can submit an Issue by selecting `BugReport`, `Enhancement` or `FeatureRequest`.

### Committer Creating ISSUES

If it is a small development task, then the process of creating an issue will be similar to users and contributors. You can  use `BugReport`, `Enhancement`, or `FeatureRequest` to associate your issue with pull requests.

If it is a relatively large planned task that needs to be broken down, use `Umbrella` to associate with the corresponding issues and plan subtasks inside `Umbrella`. The specifics are as follows:

For each subtask, create the corresponding subtask using `Subtask` and describe the specific content that needs to be completed for that subtask.

For `Umbrella`, it is temporarily divided into two categories, RBIP-* and MINOR.

RBIP-*: Indicates the addition of features and characteristics, such as RBIP-09, RBIP-10, with the sequence number increasing.

MINOR: Indicates fixing or adding small features. It can start with MINOR, followed by the title.

For `Subtask`, use the following format:
`[RBIP-*/MINOR][Style/Refactor/Performance/Docs/Test/Build/CI/Chore][Subtask] xxx`, for example,

## 2. Creating a Pull Request

If the PR is associated with an ISSUE, it must include the following in the PR content:

```
close #issue_number
```

`close` is a fixed prefix, `#` is also a fixed prefix, and `issue_number` represents the ISSUE number associated with the PR. For example:

![image](../../images/doc-image11.png)

#297, #292 are the corresponding ISSUE numbers.

For example, if you need to submit a PR to resolve ISSUE #297, the PR content should include:

```
close #297
```

When this PR is MERGED, the ISSUE will be automatically closed. After the PR is merged, the PR and ISSUE will look like this:

PR:
![image](../../images/doc-image12.png)

ISSUE:
![image](../../images/doc-image13.png)

For more details, you can refer to the [PR submission example](./Pull-Request-Example.md).

## 3. Reasons for PR Submission Failure

#### License Error

License checker / license-header-check (pull_request) failed. Some files are missing a License, which needs to be added. It is best to run the check command before each submission.

```
cargo install hawkeye

# Execute in the current project to check which files are missing a License
hawkeye check

# Automatically add a License to each code file
hawkeye format
```

#### Title Format Error

PR Title Checker / check (pull_request_target) failed due to incorrect PR title format.

```
Prefix: Title
Prefix options include: feat|fix|test|refactor|chore|style|docs|perf|build|ci|revert

feat: New feature
For example: feat: Compatible with Rocksdb

fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation change
style: Code style change (does not affect code logic), used for submissions that only involve formatting, punctuation, whitespace, etc., that do not affect code execution.
refactor: Code refactoring (code changes that are neither new features nor bug fixes)
perf: Performance optimization
test: Adding or modifying tests
chore: Miscellaneous (changes to the build process or auxiliary tools)
build: Changes to the build system or external dependencies
ci: Changes to continuous integration configuration, including modifications to configuration files and scripts.
revert: Revert
```
