RobustMQ adopts a distributed, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. Protocol Layer (Multi-Protocol Computing Layer)
- **MQTT Broker**: Handles MQTT 3.x/4.x/5.x protocols

### 2. Broker Server Layer
- **Stateless Design**: All broker nodes are stateless for horizontal scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic client distribution across broker nodes
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts different protocols to internal message format
- **Connection Management**: Handles millions of concurrent connections

### 3. Meta Service Layer (Placement Center)
- **Raft Consensus**: High-availability metadata management using Raft algorithm

### 5. Storage Layer
- **Memory Storage**: Microsecond latency for real-time applications
- **SSD Storage**: Millisecond latency for high-frequency access
- **Object Storage**: Second-level latency for cost-effective long-term storage
- **Distributed Storage**: Support for S3, HDFS, and other distributed backends
