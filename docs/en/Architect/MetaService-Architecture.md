# MetaService Architecture

## Overview

MetaService (also known as Placement Center) is the metadata management and cluster coordination center of RobustMQ. It serves as the brain of the entire system, responsible for managing cluster metadata, node coordination, fault detection, and recovery. Built on the Raft consensus algorithm, MetaService ensures high availability and strong consistency of cluster metadata.

## Design Principles

MetaService is designed with the following core principles:

- **High Availability**: Raft-based consensus ensures cluster availability even with node failures
- **Strong Consistency**: All metadata operations are strongly consistent across the cluster
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic detection and recovery from node failures
- **Scalability**: Support for dynamic cluster membership changes
- **Performance**: Optimized for low-latency metadata operations
