# Sign Your Name for Us

We're so glad you've seen us. We're trying to do something really cool, and we want to see if we can leave a little footprint in this somewhat lonely and boring career.

We're delighted that we once met at RobustMQ. Maybe we're just passing by at RobustMQ, brushing past each other. Maybe we'll travel together for a while at RobustMQ. Maybe we'll be companions at RobustMQ for a very long time.

We know that on this long journey of RobustMQ, we'll meet many people, many people will see us, and many people will pass by.

RobustMQ wants to invite you to sign your name for us, and this signature will always be displayed on our official website. Because we want to know that you once looked at us seriously. Maybe one day in the distant future, you'll suddenly remember that you once saw us, once left us a signature, and we've already traveled far. Maybe one day, we'll suddenly discover that so many people have signed for us, and we'll be very happy because of it. We'll know that we're not alone on this journey.
