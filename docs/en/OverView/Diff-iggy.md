### 1. Positioning & Strategic Goals

* **Apache Iggy**

  * Positioned as a **high-performance, Kafka-style messaging and streaming platform** focused on ultra-low latency and high throughput. Implemented in Rust, it achieves millions of messages per second with sub-millisecond P99 latency ([iggy.apache.org](https://iggy.apache.org)).
  * Uses a **custom protocol and proprietary SDKs**, suitable for embedded and self-managed deployments ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html), [github.com](https://github.com/apache/iggy)).

* **RobustMQ**

  * Aims to build a **cloud-native, multi-protocol unified messaging hub**, fully compatible with mainstream protocols such as MQTT, Kafka, AMQP, and RocketMQ ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html), [github.com](https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq)).
  * Focuses on solving challenges in elasticity, cost, and protocol fragmentation through architectural innovations such as **computeâ€“storage separation and pluggable storage backends** ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html)).

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Architecture**     | Monolithic (compute and storage tightly coupled)                                      | Layered (three-tier separation: Broker, Journal, Metadata Service) ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html)) |
| **Protocol Support**        | Custom protocol + QUIC, TCP, HTTP                                                     | Multi-protocol: MQTT, Kafka, AMQP, RocketMQ ([github.com](https://github.com/apache/iggy))                                        |
| **Client SDKs**             | Proprietary SDKs, multi-language support ([iggy.apache.org](https://iggy.apache.org)) | Compatible with community SDKs (MQTT/Kafka/AMQP) ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html))                   |
| **Storage Layer**           | Local append-only log                                                                 | Pluggable: file, S3, HDFS, MinIO ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html))                                   |
| **Ecosystem Compatibility** | New ecosystem, migration required                                                     | High compatibility, low switching cost ([robustmq.com](https://robustmq.com/OverView/Diff-iggy.html))                             |
