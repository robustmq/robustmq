RobustMQ MQTT implements the reserved message functionality of MQTT. You can mark messages published under a particular topic as "reserved messages" and save them as persistent messages on EMQX. When any new subscriber subscribes to a topic that matches the topic of the reserved message, they receive the message immediately, even if the message was published before they subscribed to the topic.
